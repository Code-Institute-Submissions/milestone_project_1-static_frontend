# Your Own Money Investments
<b>Problem Statement</b><br>
People shy away from managing their own money even though it is well known that a lot of the investment fund managers only
get paid if the money is invested, which leaves the owner of the money in a very risky situation.
<br><br>
<b>Proposed Solution</b><br>
<i>Your own money investments</i> is a website aimed at surfacing educational opportunities to people 
in the form of a) recommended reading, b) podcast recommendations, and c) a trading ideas blog managed and written by the website owner. 
It also encourages people to develop their knowledge about the field at their own pace, over time.

## UX
The user experience for the website is aimed at collating prevetted recommendations for kindle books and for podcasts, with the extra addition of 'trade ideas' blog which 
encourages users to come back to the website for the newest entries on the blog.

<b>User Story 1: Be Inspired</b><br>
- As a new user that has stumbled accross this website, I agree with the 'call to action' on the index.html page which tells the user to
'Learn - How to grow your own money safely' and the user identifies with the second statement, that they will never increase their wealth significantly
by just working a normal job. They are inspired to look for more information on the website.<br><br>

<b>User Story 2: Looking for quick reading recommendations</b><br>
- As a new or experienced user, the user clicks the 'reading' section if they are on a wide screen device or on the 'start here' drop down button which reveals the 'reading' section on a narrower screen device such as a phone, this 
allows the user to see the latest recommendations for investment books.<br><br>

<b>User Story 3: Looking for quick podcast recommendations</b><br>
- As a new or experienced user, the user clicks the 'podcasts' section if they are on a wide screen device or on the 'start here' drop down button which reveals the 'podcasts' section on a narrower screen device such as a phone, this 
allows the user to see the latest recommendations for investment podcasts.<br><br>

<b>User Story 4: Looking for quick and easy trading ideas</b><br>
- As a new or experienced user, the user clicks the 'trade ideas' section if they are on a wide screen device or on the 'start here' drop down button which reveals the 'trade ideas' section on a narrower screen device such as a phone, this 
allows the user to see the latest trade ideas that are published on the website. The user is interested in these trade ideas the most as it is the main portion of the website content that keeps getting updated and that they are getting trading insights from over time. The user checks back more frequently over time as he develops a trust with the
author.<br><br>

- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
